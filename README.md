# My Personal Project --- 2048

## *What will the application do?*


- play the 2048 game using keyboard upwards arrow(or W), downwards arrow(or S),
 leftwards arrow(or A) and rightwards arrow(or D) to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine tiles to create the number 2048.

- record the ***current score***
- record the ***highest score ever***
- start a new game in the middle of a game
- restart the game if no further moves can be done (in other words, the game ends)



## *Who will use it?*
* anyone who wants play the game




## *Why is this project of interest to you?*
I have been playing this game since my junior high school, and 
I now want to design this game from scratch on my own.
